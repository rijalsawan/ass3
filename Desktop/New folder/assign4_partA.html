				<h2>Abstract</h2>
			</div>
			<p>
				The Internet has made massive progress since the 1990s. The amount of
				traffic that crosses the Internet now is 22 million times more than what
				was generated in 1992. Although the fiber optic cables replaced the
				century-old copper cables to transmit trillions of bits per second, the
				end-user at a local area is still hungry for more bandwidth to run new
				emerging applications. This put both ISPs and the mobile network
				operators under challenges: Are they ready for the Mammoth Internet?
				Will ISPs be able to offer the capacity to meet the growing demand? Is
				their infrastructure capable of serving the future disruptive services
				such as 4K/8K technology, VR/AR, autonomous vehicles, etc? The
				literature lacks a comprehensive study of bandwidth requirements for the
				end-user in both fixed-access and mobile Internet.

				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</div>
			<p>
				The advancement of telecom technologies in recent years has opened the
				door for the development of next-generation digital services and
				applications. However, they have also led to a huge surge in data
				traffic that has evolved from Kilobytes to Exabytes over the years.
				These data-driven services have different Internet bandwidth (BW)
				requirements. Therefore, the projection of the future BW requirements
				for consumers of these services is of direct interest to Internet
				Service Providers (ISPs) and cellular networks operators. Overlooking
				this problem poses a real risk to their networks and consequently may
				impact their customers.

					<h2>Contributions</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					The coming few years will be critical for cellular operators and ISPs
					to make their future networks adaptable to include a multitude of
					cellular-enabled devices and services. The contributions of this paper
					are as follows.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Identify most disruptive bandwidth drivers for both fixed-access
						Internet and cellular-based Internet.
					</li>
					<li class="BoldItalic">
						Provide a case study of flagship smartphones and their bandwidth
						requirements for streaming video contents.
					</li>
					<li>
						Develop forecasting models for both fixed-access Internet, and
						cellular-based mobile Internet; and then project the future
						bandwidth requirements for the users of both networks by year 2021.
					</li>
					<li class="BoldItalic">
						Conduct multiple experiments to show the validity of our models, and
						the impact of each bandwidth driver on the future of bandwidth
						requirements.

						This paper provides an insightful projection of the future bandwidth
						of both fixed-access and mobile Internet. For the two approaches,
						fixed-access and mobile Internet, we identify the bandwidth drivers
						and compare them in terms of their impact on the future bandwidth
						demand. We design our models of fixed-access/mobile Internet to
						cover a wide variety of household/connection-sharing types and as
						well as usersâ€™ Internet usage behavior. Our findings in fixed-access
						Internet show that 4K and VR/AR technology will shape the future of
						residential bandwidth. On the other hand, while IoT is growing on an
						everyday basis with many potential innovative technologies, it will
						not alter the bandwidth consumption pattern of typical households.
						Our model predicts a jump in residential bit rate demand, especially
						for houses that adopt more new technology such as VR/AR and 4K video
						streaming. We project that more than 35% of households will demand a
						bit rate speed of more than 100 Mbps, and 10% will require more than
						300 Mbps.
